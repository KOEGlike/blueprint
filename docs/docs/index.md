# Welcome to Blueprint

## Earn up to $400 to make any hardware project

Blueprint is a little like a you-ship-we-ship, you-ship-we-ship.

### You ship:

A design of your hardware project. This includes 3d models, PCB’s, simulations, assemblies, firmware.

### We ship:

A grant that allows you to purchase the required parts for your project. **This grant does not depend on the time spend making the project.**

### You ship (again):

Journal the time spent building your project and track the hours. We will give you 10 tickets for every approved hour you spend making your project work. Each tier of project has a cap for the number of tickets you can get from it. **It is not expected that you reach this amount.**

### We ship (again):

You can use the tickets that you earn from logging your build-time and use it to buy prizes from the [Toolbag](/toolbag)

How does it work?
Here is how it works:
There are four tiers that a project can follow and they are as follows:

#### Tier 4: up to $50 and a limit of 400 tickets

- A basic project that doesn’t require much time. This is a project that is cool but not very unique. Examples include:
  - A drone (it doesn’t have many custom parts)
  - A custom ubikey
  - A custom LED lamp
  - A custom keyboard/macropad

#### Tier 3: up to $100 and a limit of 625 tickets

- An intermediate custom project that has a bit more of that “flare”. Typically, this would include multiple components such as a case and PCB. This is something that your friends would say “oh that’s cool”. Examples include:
  - A full **split** keyboard
  - A MIDI
  - A custom game console

#### Tier 2: up to $200 and a limit of 1250 tickets

- A fairly advanced project that you are very proud of. This is something that your friends would tell **Their** friends about. Examples include:
  - A Fairy weight battle Bot
  - A custom robot arm
  - A custom devboard

#### Tier 1: up to $400 and up to 2500 tickets

- A super advanced project that would be the cornerstone of your portfolio. This is the type of project that people don’t believe you made.
  - A 3d Printer
  - A CNC mill/router
  - A custom robot dog
  - A custom FPGA board

# Please note!!!

To be a higher tier (ex. tier 1) does not mean that you need to cost in the $200-$400 range. Actually, we would MUCH prefer you made the highest quality projects for as cheap as possible. So PLEASE don’t think that a cheaper project means it’s lower quality.
