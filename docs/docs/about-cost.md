# The Relationship Between Hack Club and Cost

If you do not know what Hack Club is, we are a 501c3 non-profit based in Shelburne, Vermont. We have run many large and expensive programs such as [Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/), [Outernet](https://outernet.hackclub.com/), [Boreal](https://boreal.hackclub.com/) and many more.

However,

# We do not have infinite money!

Every dollar we spend, we need to fundraise ourselves. We would like to make it last to create as many cool projects as possible.

That said, please always do what you can to select the cheaper option while making a project. This could include the following

- Not making projects that are simply expensive for the sake of it, maybe order your parts seperately and learn how to solder!
- Always choosing the cheapest option, such as GSDR, even when it comes at the cost of your time (start a new project in the meantime)
- Selecting the cheapest part for whatever you are making. (You don’t need a raspberry pi 5 to blink an LED)
- Most importantly, if you have the parts to build your project at home, don’t just request the grant for the sake of it. You can still get tickets for tracking the build!

If you are ever stuck on cost optimizing, ask around on the Slack, the community is very helpful!
