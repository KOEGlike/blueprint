## Think you're ready to ship? Read this!

When you do the ship flow, your repository is already verified to have certain files such as a 
- BOM.csv
- ReadMe.md



Along with some other requirements. However, in order to have a project be truly "shipped", there are some other requirements that are harder to automatically check. 

-----------

### 1) Original project 

If you follow guides from online or even from the [guides](/guides), thats fine! However, you need have an original touch to the project. This is something different for every project. For the split keyboard, maybe add lights that flash different colors based on the program, etc. We WILL verify that your project is original even if you create it from some obscure guide.

-----------

### 2) Polished project

This means that you have a nice looking ReadMe.md, all of your required files (see below), a good description of what the project is for and how to use the files to recreate the project. You should render or screenshot any of the 3d models for the projects and once you build the project, add a GIF or video of the project working. 

-----------

### 3) Required files 

The required files depend on your project type. For typical PCB projects it even differs on KiCAD vs EasyEDA. A good rule of thumb is to upload **AT LEAST** the files required to fully recreate the project. For KiCAD, you will need:

- `.kicad_pcb`, file representing the KiCad PCB Layout
- `.kicad_sch`, for your schematic
- `.kicad_pro`, your project file
- `.wrl` 3D Model of your PCB

For EasyEDA, you will need your:
- Gerber
- Pick an place



For projects with 3d models, you will also need the `.obj` or `.step` files for each part along with the project assembly.


Once you meet all of the requirements, your project is good to submit!
