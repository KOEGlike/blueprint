Keep your changes as low impact as possible. You do not need to give me a summary of changes. You do not need to test the changes. Try to reference other parts of the codebase to ensure your changes are consistent with the existing code style and practices. Keep your responses concise and focused.

Read all context and instructions carefully before making changes. Do not suggest code that has been deleted or is no longer relevant.

This project uses ruby 3.4.4 and rails 8.0.2.1. Make sure to only suggest changes that are applicable to those versions. Prefer to use the cli to generate boilerplate rather than generate it manually. You can always modify code generated from the cli.
