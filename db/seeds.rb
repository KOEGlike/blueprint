    description: "Serenity is a drumpad or macropad designed with musicians in mind. Instead of using traditional switches or buttons, it uses a copper layer on the PCB to detect touch input. Powered by an ESP32-S3 devkit, Serenity can store sound files on a microSD card and output audio through a headphone jack. It features 2 configurable buttons that let you switch between sound layers â€” allowing you to play many more sounds than just 8. For example, with 4 layers, you can trigger 32 unique sounds.",
